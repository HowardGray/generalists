    <p>Zorro is a job board for multi-skilled talent. 
      <br><br>We connect companies with skilled generalists, polymaths and hybrids who possess diverse experience and expertise.<br>
</p>
    <p>
<br>
<h4>What is Zorro?</h4>

    <p>
    	We noticed existing online hiring solutions didn't accommodate companies or talent who wanted to look outside the box of tightly constrained job titles and role specs.<br><br>
We could see that smart businesses needed savvy, hands-on generalists just as much as they needed specialists but getting hold of them was tough.<br><br>
Zorro is here to help companies hire talent with a broad range of skills across a multitude of disciplines, and to help those talented operators, producers, builders and can-doers access exciting new projects.
</p>
<br><br>
    <p>
<h4>Who's on Zorro?</h4>
Companies using Zorro include early stage tech startups looking for core team members to supercharge their growth, media and entertainment businesses building new ventures, and corporate education providers searching for talented teachers and facilitators.<br><br>
The Zorro talent pool features exited entrepreneurs, strategy consultants with side hustle, plug-in COOs and sales professionals with operational chops to boot.

<h4>Why 'Zorro'?</h4>
Professor Phillip Tetlock conducted a 20+ year study of 284 professional forecasters. <br><br>
He asked them to predict the probability of various occurrences both within and outside of their areas of expertise. <br><br>
Analysis of the 80,000+ forecasts found that experts are less accurate predictors than non-experts in their area of expertise.<br><br>
Tetlock’s conclusion: when seeking accuracy of predictions, it is better to turn to those like “(Isaiah) Berlin’s prototypical fox, those who know many little things, draw from an eclectic array of traditions, and accept ambiguity and contradictions.”
We believe the Fox, or Zorro, will continue to be of growing value and importance to companies across the globe.</p>
